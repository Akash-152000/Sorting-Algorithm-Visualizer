# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.

The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. Below we see five such implementations of sorting in python.

* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Shell Sort
* Selection Sort
