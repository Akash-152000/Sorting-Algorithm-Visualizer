# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

![Demo](gif.gif)

Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.

The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. Below we see five such implementations of sorting in python.

* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Shell Sort
* Selection Sort

## Getting started

Open your terminal

From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.

Run the below snippet.
```
git clone https://github.com/Akash-152000/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
```
### Prerequisites

Install the required libraries using the below command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

run the **sorting visualizer.py** file.

Still incase any ImportError occurs install the **Pygame** module using pip.
```
pip install pygame
```
## Running 

For now the code contains only two sorting algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Merge Sort

## Instructions

* **For Bubble sort press :arrow_up: on your keyboard**

* **For Selection sort press :arrow_down: on your keyboard**

* **For Merge sort press :arrow_left: on your keyboard**

* **Press R on your keyboard to genrate new array.**
**Note: Let the sorting of arrays done before pressing button**
