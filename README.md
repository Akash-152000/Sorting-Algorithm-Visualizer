# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common orders are in numerical or lexicographical order.

The importance of sorting lies in the fact that data searching can be optimized to a very high level, if data is stored in a sorted manner. Sorting is also used to represent data in more readable formats. Below we see five such implementations of sorting in python.

* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Shell Sort
* Selection Sort

## Getting started

Open your terminal

From a terminal window, change to the local directory where you want to clone your repository.

Run the below snippet.
```
git clone https://github.com/Akash-152000/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
```
### Prerequisites

Since venv is present no need to install any library.

run the **sorting visualizer.py** file.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
